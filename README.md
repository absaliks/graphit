# graphit
*My very first java project.*

Small program that reads txt-log files of "some" device, generates chart and creates error log which contains:<br>
-- parsing errors *(simply bad text data)*<br>
-- lines' validity errors *(by comparing hash sums)*

P.S. Customer asked for some new features, and just so happens that I have to heavily refactor code to make 'em live.

P.P.S. ... and great thing is I have rights to post it here under GPL!
